# Collisions Simulation
The goal of this project was to create a physics collisions simulation, similar to the collisions simulation on the PHET Interactive Simulations website.
With the help of tutorials on Pymunk and Pygame, as well as example projects on the Pymunk official website, I was able to create an accurate simulation of balls colliding, the effect of gravity, friction, applying impulse to an object, etc.
